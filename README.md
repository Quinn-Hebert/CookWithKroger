# Inspiration
The inspiration behind cook with Kroger was to try to make an interactive and dynamic webpage that can help simplify the shopping experience for any Kroger customer.

# What it does
CookWithKroger was made with convenience in mind. Customers will be able to search recipes within their budget from CookWithKroger.com while filtering recipes by price, category, and time to cook, and even number or servings, scaling the recipe to fit your needs. Once a recipe is selected, CookWithKroger will list all the ingredients needed ready to be added to the cart with one click. It will also provide resources to help with the preparation, including step by step instructions and even videos.

# How we built it
We created the database using PostgreSQL, modeled after 84.51's data provided. The back-end was written in java and front-end was HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

# Challenges we ran into
We struggled with CSS formatting and database design.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the product we were able to pump out in our first hackathon with only 7 weeks of coding knowledge. Our idea was ambitious given our skills, but we were able to complete everything we set out to do and present a workable MVP.

# What we learned
We learned how to integrate a full-stack application from database to user. None of us had much experience using CSS, HTML or bootstrap.

# What's next for CookWithKroger
In the future, we believe that CookWithKroger can effectively cut google out as the middle man between meal planning and shopping. This could be used online through ClickList or even in store; using the Kroger mobile application and showing aisle locations of the products needed. We will also be able to offer the ability to filter out any allergies or dietary restrictions. Using CookWithKroger regularly will allow the application to make smarter suggestions, based on your grocery buying pattern and what ingredients it believes you already have at home. Connecting your calendar app will also allow you to schedule selected recipes to your upcoming week, making life simpler and eliminating the daily "What's for dinner?" from the rest of the family.
